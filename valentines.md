## How i want to build this

First I want to start with the homepage that asks to be my valentine.

Handwriting-like text box with 2 option. If he clicks yes it continues, if he clicks no then a series of events happen

- clicks no once - gets a notification that the button is unavailable and he should try again
- clicks a second time and the button gets smaller and moves
- third time the button dissappears compeletly and the yes button expands
